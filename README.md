## [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. These restrictions are reflected in the three principles of Redux.
- [Single source of truth](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html#single-source-of-truth): The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
- [State is read-only](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html#state-is-read-only): The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
- [Changes are made with pure functions](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html#changes-are-made-with-pure-functions): To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
